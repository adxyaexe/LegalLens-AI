# ‚öñÔ∏è LegalLens AI: Contract Analyzer (Gemini Version)

LegalLens AI is a Streamlit application prototype designed to make contract review faster and more accessible using **Google's Gemini models**. It provides features for clause splitting, plain-English summarization, heuristic risk detection, and interactive Q&A against any uploaded legal document.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Document Upload:** Supports ingestion of **PDF, DOCX, and plain text** contracts.
* **Clause Splitting:** Heuristically breaks down large contract texts into manageable, numbered clauses for focused review.
* **AI Summarization:** Uses the **Gemini API** to generate plain-English summaries of specific clauses, including identified obligations, risks, and suggested actions (output as structured JSON).
* **Risk Radar (Heuristic):** A customizable, regex/keyword-based system to instantly flag high-risk terms like `non-compete`, `auto-renew`, and `one-sided indemnity`.
* **Persona-Specific Analysis:** Generates targeted summaries for roles like **Tenant**, **Employee**, or **Freelancer**, highlighting points most relevant to their interests.
* **Interactive Q&A:** Allows users to ask natural language questions about the entire contract content, with answers generated by Gemini and supported by direct clause citations.

### Prerequisites

You need **Python 3.8+** and a **Google API Key**.

1.  **Set up the Virtual Environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    # venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Create a file named `requirements.txt` and populate it with the following packages:

    **`requirements.txt`**
    ```
    streamlit
    google-generativeai
    pdfplumber
    python-docx
    tqdm
    regex
    python-dotenv
    ```

    Then install them:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set up your API Key:**
    Create a file named **`.env`** in the same directory as your `Legal.py` script and add your Google API key:

    **`.env`**
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="AIzaSy..."
    ```

### Running the Application
